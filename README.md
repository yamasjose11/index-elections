# Are Election Years the Best Time to Invest?

## How I came about choosing this project?

  I have always had a very deep rooted interest in finance and I thought it would be worth applying my techincal background skills from engineering to data science to approach this problem. With the help of my instructors at Galvanize Inc. I was able to get good guidance in how I should begin to approach this problem.

## Data Collection:
  Three open source datasets were collected from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), in order to explore my question listed in the abstract section.
  
  * **Dow Jones dataset contains:**
    * 9000+ entries, 7 columns 
    * Adjustable back to 1985 to 2020
    * 748.3 kB file size
  
  * **Nasdaq dataset contains:**
    * 12000+ entries, 7 columns 
    * Adjustable back to 1971 to 2020
    * 957.8 kB file size
  
  * **S&P 500 dataset contains:**
    * 23000+ entries, 7 columns 
    * Adjustable back to 1927 to 2020
    * 1.7 MB file size

## Statistical Approach:
I chose to go with a very strict significance level of 0.01, given the fact that there is various external factors not being taken into considered for this project. For the proposed hypothesis I will be conducting a Welch's t-test to test for the sample mean a period* before election and after.

  Null Hypothesis: The adjusted closing price mean after presidential elections is different than before elections.
  Alt. Hypothesis: The adjusted closing price mean after presidential elections is **not** different than before elections.

## What Does the Data Say?
  After conduction my tests before and after election years for all presidents after 1995. I have come to the conclusion that more data is required and additional statistical tests are required. The following table will show my results for each president across the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P500.

## Future Development:
  For future development points it would be very cool to test for corrolation across markets such as other major indices, cryptocurrencies, bonds and more. It would also be very cool to implement machine learning techniques to measure volatility and read market structure. 

## Awknowledgements:
  Thank you to the instructors at Galvanize Inc., Dan Rupp, Juliana Duncan, Justin Wallander and Zach Schuiz for their help and guidance during this project. Also, thank you to my classmates especially Hilmi Kilickaya and Vinay Vakharia for their comprehensive suggestions.

________________________________
Proposed outline of Capstone Expectations Worksheet 
Readme. The github repo must include a well-formatted README.md that explains the capstone. At a minimum, the README should cover the following topics: 

## Introduction: An overview of the problem your capstone solves. Focus on convincing the reader that there is a real need for this work to someone. Not everyone needs to be a consumer of your problem, but it must add something to someoneâ€™s life. 

## Data: What data did you collect and use? Why are these data appropriate to your capstone, and in which ways are they deficient? 

## Methods: What methods did you use to analyze the data. Why were these methods appropriate? How did you select these methods? What other options did you have, and why did you pass them over. 

## Results: What did you learn and how do you know it? 

## Further Steps: What will you do next? What did you learn during your analysis that you would like to enhance or correct.
