________________________________
Proposed outline of Capstone Expectations Worksheet 
Readme. The github repo must include a well-formatted README.md that explains the capstone. At a minimum, the README should cover the following topics: 

## Introduction: An overview of the problem your capstone solves. Focus on convincing the reader that there is a real need for this work to someone. Not everyone needs to be a consumer of your problem, but it must add something to someoneâ€™s life. 

## Data: What data did you collect and use? Why are these data appropriate to your capstone, and in which ways are they deficient? 

## Methods: What methods did you use to analyze the data. Why were these methods appropriate? How did you select these methods? What other options did you have, and why did you pass them over. 

## Results: What did you learn and how do you know it? 

## Further Steps: What will you do next? What did you learn during your analysis that you would like to enhance or correct.
